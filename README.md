I am honored to inform you that we have won the prize for the best project ðŸ¥‡ of the AI course at the 9th edition of the project ball.

Our Pneumonia/covid detections project is an artificial artificial intelligence project, the aim of which was to use machine learning techniques to train, deploy and monitor a machine learning model machine learning model capable of classifying with very high patients with pneumonia, Covid or healthy patients. or healthy patients. through X-ray images of their thoracic cages.

To successfully complete this project, we had to overcome a number of technical challenges in data preparation. the choice of the best image resolution for best memory performance memory performance, choosing the best filter to highlight the most 
highlight the most pixels responsible for the anomaly.

For model learning, the problem was that of choice of the best tools and/or algorithms to maximize accuracy. So, after several trials, we opted for Tensi's Functional Api the TensorFlow/Keras functional Api. This will enable us to merge two 
independently sensitive algorithms on different classes. This will result in a more robust, scalable model and increased accuracy accuracy for the different classes to be classified.

For the purposes of model optimization, scalability and continuous integration, Kera
